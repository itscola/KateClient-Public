(**Click** on the ClickGUI to enable or close the modules, or **slide** the scroll wheel up and down to see more modules.)


And, you can install any **mod** you want if mods are compatible.

### To do:
1. Loading GUI screen.   
2. ClickGUI dock.
3. WidgetManager relative position handler.

Actually the UI design progress takes more time.

### The client is in the development stage.
When KateClient development is finished, I will release KateClient and provide the download URL.

#### Prohibited for commercial use.
Why the ui is apple style, because Im an apple fan.   But to be a student,I dont have a my own macbook at present.       

## Some classes was created before development. 
This is no problem , I always create most of the classes during the programming design phase.
